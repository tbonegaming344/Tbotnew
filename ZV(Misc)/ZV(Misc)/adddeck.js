2. Deck must not be hacked can't run cards not included in hero and can't run more than 4 copies of a card. Do not sumbit pvzh decks made in modded versions of the game. Tbot is solely for pvzh decks only not for pvzh mods like syndrome and others.
3. Deck is unique with a meaningful difference from ones currently posted, for example: don't make another Valkster 
4. You may still submit and replace a similar deck if you think yours is significantly better with your argument of why it's better. 
5. The goal of Tbot decks is to compile relatively optimized versions of decks of all types.
